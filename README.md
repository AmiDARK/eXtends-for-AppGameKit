# eXtends for AppGameKit

This is a portage of my old product eXtends that was initially developed for DarkBASIC Professional software from TheGameCreators

## Introduction

eXtends is a set of commands/methods to add new functionalities to AppGameKit, and to improve some others.

## Source Code Access

You can now download a copy of the very latest source code of the eXtends for AppGameKit commands set.
It is given with few samples on how to use eXtends with AppGameKit software from TheGameCreators

## Issues Tracker

At any time, you can review current issues, report new ones and for moderators and collaborations, even tick off bugs that have been fixed, or edit them with additional details to keep the work of solving critical issues alive. No more digging around forums and social feeds for whether a bug has been reported, or how to report one, as it's now all under one roof.



## Permitted Usage (License)

Technically, eXtends is not an open source project however, to allow user to use it in the AppGameKit creations, the only way found was to make source code being available for download.
All these simply mean that all material is copyright Frédéric Cordier (8.8.75 France) and any project that may use parts of eXtends must clearly mentions in a fully visible way that :
"This software uses part of eXtends addon for AppGameKit from Frédéric Cordier (available at : https://github.com/AmiDARK/eXtends-for-AppGameKit/ ) "
eXtends is provided for free. That mean that no fee is required to have the rights to use if for any project (freeware, commercial, shareware, etc.).
